# bamazon

Bamazon is an "amazon-like" storefront CLI node application that allows you to order items that you would like to purchase.


Firing off the application (node bamazonCustomer.js) brings up the the table of items the store currently has to offer. It will then bring up a series of questions to see exactly what you want from the store


It will then check stock to see if it's available in the quantity ordered, it will ship to you!

Here is an example of it in progress:
